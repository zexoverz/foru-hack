<img width="1275" height="665" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-26 205002" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b701bcd-0969-49d2-90fa-e4ec9c2a736f" />

## Executive Summary

The DID Claim Improvement System is a decentralized identity solution that enables users to make claims about their identity using cryptographic keys, with AI agents facilitating the verification and management process through smart contracts.

## Problem Statement

Current identity verification systems are centralized, creating single points of failure and privacy concerns. Users need a decentralized way to make identity claims that can be verified and managed without relying on centralized authorities.

## Solution Overview

A blockchain-based system where users generate public/private key pairs to make identity claims, with AI agents acting as intermediaries to create and manage DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) through smart contracts.

## User Stories

### Primary Users
- **End Users**: Individuals who want to create and manage decentralized identity claims
- **AI Agents**: Automated systems that facilitate DID creation and contract management
- **Verifiers**: Entities that need to verify user claims

### Core User Stories

**As an End User:**
- I want to generate a secure key pair so that I can create cryptographic claims about my identity
- I want to send my public key to a backend system so that my identity can be processed
- I want to use my private key to sign claims so that I can prove ownership of my identity
- I want my claims to be processed automatically so that I don't need manual verification steps

**As an AI Agent:**
- I want to receive public keys from users so that I can create corresponding DIDs
- I want to deploy smart contracts so that identity claims can be managed on-chain
- I want to call smart contract functions with user public keys and DIDs so that identity relationships are established

## Technical Specifications

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/keys/submit
- Accept user public keys
- Return processing confirmation

GET /api/v1/claims/{user_id}/status
- Check claim processing status
- Return DID when available

POST /api/v1/claims/verify
