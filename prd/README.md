# Product Requirements Document: DID Claim Improvement & Community Membership System

## Executive Summary

The DID Claim Improvement & Community Membership System is a decentralized identity solution that enables users to make claims about their identity using cryptographic keys, with AI agents facilitating the verification and management process through smart contracts. Once users have established their DID, they can create community memberships through a "fuse with community" process that generates membership data and indexes results in the backend.

## Problem Statement

Current identity verification systems are centralized, creating single points of failure and privacy concerns. Additionally, community membership and participation lacks proper decentralized infrastructure. Users need a decentralized way to make identity claims that can be verified and managed without relying on centralized authorities, and then use those verified identities to participate in communities with transparent membership tracking.

## Solution Overview

A two-phase blockchain-based system:

**Phase 1: DID Creation** - Users generate public/private key pairs to make identity claims, with AI agents acting as intermediaries to create and manage DIDs as ERC721 NFTs through smart contracts. Each DID becomes a unique, transferable token representing the user's decentralized identity.

**Phase 2: Community Membership** - Once users have established their DID NFTs, they can "fuse with community" to create membership data that gets indexed and stored in the backend system, enabling community participation and governance using their NFT-based identity.
